# Project-Examples
Here is a repository of the large-scale coding projects I have worked on in the past

  OUR System Project: An independent project to create a program to allow students, teachers, and department staff of a school to access appropriate records for their position (students access and alter schedule, teachers access rolls and classes, department staff access basic info on department). Â Each section of the program is reachable by a homepage, which would accept a username and passowrd.  Written in Java, contains a runnable JAR file. 
  Caribbean_Stud_Poker: A group project that acted as my practice capstone project.  Worked with classmates to develop a variant of poker called Caribbean Stud Poker.  A majority of the functionalities are finished, but due to time constraints, the full game and an appealing GUI was not able to be developed.  Written in Java, contains a runnable JAR file.
